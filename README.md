## Motovation

I wanted to create an easy to use CLI that had a pourpose in the workplace but also tested my abilities thus far in backend development

## Installation

Installation is easy! Copy the package from my repo and in the command line enter 'npm i' in order to download the dependances. Then you must source and seed the database using mysql2. Once this is done you can type 'npm start' and the app will run

## Challenges

This was by far the hardest assignment I have done through the course. I spent alot of time in office hours talking to teachers and getting assistance from my peers. During this period I have gone through some household changes that left me with less time than usual to focus on the project which effected my understanding.
Also the breadth of code was more than any challenge to date which I found dificult to keep up with

## Successes

My highest success with this project was getting the update employee function running. This code tested all my knowledge and patience - there was a bug where it was running 2 prompts at the same time and people on the helpline couldnt figure it out - then boom I worked it out myself. (I needed to nest one of the prompts!)
